    <h1>Tim's Spectrum Games</h1>
    <p>
      Lovingly crafted in my teenage years on a black and white monitor with a single ZX Spectrum, a rubbish tape recorder, and a set of C15 tapes. Graphics were done in Melbourne Draw. I've forgotten the name of the excellent assembler I used; I'll dig it out later.

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/MASTSERV.TAP">Master and Servant</a>: This was my last, best, game. It wasn't published, howver - the industry had moved past the ability of a 17-year-old with a tape deck and Melbourne Draw.

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/JOCKTIME.TAP">Jock and the Time Rings</a>This was commercially published by Atlantis Software, a budget publisher, and did OK. Reviews weren't great, and I really needed to understand acceleration and multi-pixel moves, but it's still a pretty fun game. My friends at Uni spent hours playing it in our lounge in an early example of multi-screening.
