    <h1>Tim's Spectrum Games</h1>
    <p>
      Lovingly crafted in my teenage years on a black and white monitor with a single ZX Spectrum, a rubbish tape recorder, and a set of C15 tapes, my games live on, online. Creating one of these was quite an undertaking - some hundreds of hours, once you've allowed for all the time taken for things to be saved, verified,and loaded to test pieces of code - but I won't go into all that here. All the graphics were done in Melbourne Draw. I've forgotten the name of the excellent assembler I used; I'll dig it out later. Everything was of course in Z80 assembler, AKA "machine code". Practically every byte of memory was used, including the printer buffer. I have a book with all the memory locations - variables, graphics, major routine start points, etc - listed, along with all the stuff about formats and so on.

      You can play the games directly online from the links below - just click the game name. You need to be on Chrome for sound to work. If you download the TAP files separately to play on another emulator - <a href="http://jsspeccy.zxdemo.org/">jsspeccy</a> works well - you do need to choose a 48K Spectrum emulator to make them work. A 128K emulator won't run them.

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/MASTSERV.TAP">Master and Servant</a>: This was my last, best, game. It wasn't published, however - the industry had moved past the ability of a 17-year-old with a tape deck and Melbourne Draw to compete. In this game there are two ways to win - either complete all the tasks, or get hold of gold crucifix and drop it by The Master. This requires you to find other things from cupboards and stuff, which then react together to form the gold crucifix. TAP file is <a href="https://oldhamtj.github.io/MASTSERV.TAP">here.</a> (Tip: press the space bar to nip through the intro sequence credits more quickly.)

      There's more info on this one, including screenshots and publication info, over at the <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003407">Master and Servant page on World of Spectrum.</a>

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/JOCKTIME.TAP">Jock and the Time Rings</a>: This was commercially published by Atlantis Software, a budget publisher, and did OK. Reviews weren't great, and I really needed to understand acceleration and multi-pixel moves, but it's still a pretty fun game. My friends at Uni spent hours playing it in our lounge in an early example of multi-screening. All you have to do in this game is collect all the rings, which gradually decay while you're in the room and will kill you if they decay too far.
