    <h1>Tim's Spectrum Games</h1>
    <p>
      Lovingly crafted in my teenage years on a black and white monitor with a single ZX Spectrum, a rubbish tape recorder, and a set of C15 tapes, my games live on, online. Creating one of these was quite an undertaking - some hundreds of hours, once you've allowed for all the time taken for things to be saved, verified,and loaded to test pieces of code - but I won't go into all that here. All the graphics were done in Melbourne Draw. I've forgotten the name of the excellent assembler I used; I'll dig it out later. Everything was of course in Z80 assembler, AKA "machine code". Practically every byte of memory was used, including the printer buffer. I have a book with all the memory locations - variables, graphics, major routine start points, etc - listed, along with all the stuff about formats and so on.

      You can play the games directly online from the links below. If you download the TAP files separately, you do need a 48K Spectrum emulator to make them work. A 128K emulator won't run them.

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/MASTSERV.TAP">Master and Servant</a>: This was my last, best, game. It wasn't published, howver - the industry had moved past the ability of a 17-year-old with a tape deck and Melbourne Draw.

      <a href="http://torinak.com/qaop#l=https://oldhamtj.github.io/JOCKTIME.TAP">Jock and the Time Rings</a>: This was commercially published by Atlantis Software, a budget publisher, and did OK. Reviews weren't great, and I really needed to understand acceleration and multi-pixel moves, but it's still a pretty fun game. My friends at Uni spent hours playing it in our lounge in an early example of multi-screening.
